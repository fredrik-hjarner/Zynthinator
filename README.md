[Test out Zynthinator (may not be updated to lastest version)](http://fredrikhjarner.se "Test out Zynthinator")

### Goals

- Allow to create interesting sounds by combining and mixing basic waveforms with Web Audio API.
- Ability to set as many dynamic parameters as possible, all stored with Redux.
- Nice and maintainable code.
- As much as possible should happen in real-time. No loading times. If you want to change frequencies, scales, octaves, inject some stupid node wherever then just do it and notice the results immediately.
